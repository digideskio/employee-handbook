# What is Zinc
Zinc exists for three reasons:

* To demonstrate that work cultures of learning, trust, respect, empathy,
  collective ownership, inclusion and social compassion are not incompatible with
  running a successful business.
* To provide gainful tech employment for those who struggle to find work in the existing
  hiring landscape.
* To build our employees' agency and opportunities by providing financial
  stability and professional development, as well as the time and funding to create
  businesses of their own.

## Our Vision

Our dream is to end involuntary unemployment in the United States by 2050.
Financial liberty is key to a strong economy; and we believe by empowering
Zinc employees and customers to build their successful businesses we can usher
in an age of prosperity the likes of which the world has never seen.


## Our Plan

In 2015, our goal is to build ZincMade (Zinc's consulting division) into a
$500,000 a year business. The revenue from ZincMade will be re-invested into
three things:

* Our employees, via a living wage, excellent benefits, and profit sharing.
* Our purposeful partners, via revenue sharing, pro-bono or steeply
  discounted labor, and investments of Zinc's social capital.
* Zinc's growth and financial health. Our goal is to have 6 months in expenses
  in the bank by the end of 2015.

## Our Team

Zinc has four main stakeholders:

* Employees. These compassionate, diligent, empathetic lifelong learners are
  critical to Zinc's success. Without them, we are nothing.
* Customers. These people and businesses are the lifeblood of Zinc. By serving
  our customers well and delighting them at every step of the way we ensure our
  employees continued well being.
* Advisors. These people with significant experience and expertise provide a
  way to check and balance the executives profit motive and inexperience.
* Executives. Executives are responsible for guiding Zinc in the right
  direction; making financial and personnel decisions; and establishing the
  social norms of respect, work-life balance, compassion, social impact and
  customer delight.
